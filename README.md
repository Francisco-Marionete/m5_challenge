# m5_challenge

## Introduction
The challenge is to predict the sales of the different items in 10 stores accross 3 states in the United States, making a total of 20.000++ series to predict.

Different approaches were explored:

- ARIMA models
- Auto ARIMA
- Facebook's Prophet
- LGBM
- DART (in progress..)

## Conclusion
Giving the amount of series to predict, the only feasable approach is regular ML models (LGBM) or deep learning.
